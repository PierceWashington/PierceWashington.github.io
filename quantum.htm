				<h2>Taming Timezones</h2>
				<h3>Global Rollout for BigMachines</h3>
				<p class="callOut">A global rollout of BigMachines CPQ to streamline Quantum's quoting process for their internal sales team and partner community.</p>
				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>Quantum Corporation is a global leader in data protection and big data management. They build large, complex backup systems that enable their customers to safely backup, manage, and retain large amounts of information.  Quantum had an outdated CPQ tool that was not integrated with SalesForce and difficult to use. Sales reps had no ability to create their own quotes, and their partner channel was also unable to create quotes.</p>
				<p>Quantum needed a unified, robust CPQ solution that could be implemented across continents, and integrated with their existing SalesForce CRM solution. They turned to BigMachines, who in turn recommended Pierce Washington as a partner to help plan and carry out this complex implementation of multiple systems and cloud components, and then bring their users up to speed.</p>
				<blockquote>"It is a relationship, rather than just one job for them."<br/>
				<span class="attribution">&#8212; Renae Penner, Director, Sales Applications, Quantum</span></blockquote>
				<h3>Solution / Result</h3>
				<p>Pierce Washington was an ideal fit for this engagement. Because of our extensive experience with CPQ tools, we had worked with Quantum's legacy CPQ tool and had a good plan for how best to transition Quantum to BigMachines. This gave Quantum added confidence in our abilities.</p>
				<p>Working closely with Quantum, we utilized our Storyboard process to design a global solution that would meet the needs of both their sales organization across the US, EMEA, and Asia-Pac, as well as their channel partners. We assessed their business needs and found several opportunities to streamline their current sales automation.</p> 
				<p>The global rollout went without a hitch, and user adoption went very smoothly. Thanks to BigMachine's tighter integration and accuracy, Quantum's sales force has been quantifiably more efficient.</p>
				<p>According to Quantum Director of Sales Applications Renae Penner, "They know their stuff when it comes to Big Machines implementation... I could call at anytime and they were happy to talk with me. It is a relationship, rather than just one job for them.  I would look for reasons to work with them again."</p>
