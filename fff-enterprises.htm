				<h2>New Revenue Roadmap</h2>
				<h3>Unfolding New Paths to Revenue</h3>
				<p class="callOut">Pierce Washington provided FFF Enterprises with an eBusiness Roadmap to guide their web sales and support strategy, giving them a framework to increase revenue and reduce costs, while also supporting new opportunities for untapped B2C revenue.</p>
				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>Over the past twenty years, FFF Enterprises has grown by providing superior customer service. Their overall customer strategy includes a field sales force that manages their largest customer relationships, an inside sales team, and a team of customer service representatives to take orders, check order status, and provide other manual customer support.</p>
				<p>As a company, they were faced with the following business challenges:</p>
				<p> 
					<ul>
						<li><span class="emphasis">Increase revenue:</span> By increasing the number of customer orders placed on-line, they could shift existing CSRs to revenue-generating positions to increase revenue without increasing headcount.</li>
						<li><span class="emphasis">New channel opportunities:</span> Historically, FFF Enterprises was a B2B organization. However, they recognized a new B2C channel that could dramatically increase their revenue. The existing technology platform would not scale to take advantage of that opportunity.</li>
						<li><span class="emphasis">Inefficient manual processes:</span> Nearly all orders were taken via telephone and fax. There was a tremendous opportunity to shift the order mix without compromising customer satisfaction.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<blockquote>"By soliciting input from each stakeholder group, everyone bought into the process and recommendations."<br/>
				<span class="attribution">&#8212; Bob Coates, VP, Technology, FFF Enterprises</span></blockquote>
				<h3>Solution / Result</h3>
				<p>Pierce Washington conducted a two-week, fixed price eBusiness Roadmap. The process included:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Interviewing subject matter experts to understand their current state, and business leaders (CFO, COO, VPs Marketing) to understand future state business goals.</li>
						<li>Documenting the "as-is" state and "to-be" state to identify a set of recommendations and considerations based on the desired path forward.</li>
						<li>Creating an eBusiness roadmap to provide a strategic plan for how they could leverage the web to achieve their business goals. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The eBusiness Roadmap provided the following benefits for our client:</p>
				<p><span class="emphasis">Alignment:</span> Key business and IT stakeholders are aligned in terms of their eBusiness goals and how and where to utilize technology to enable those goals.</p>
				<p><span class="emphasis">Objective Point of View:</span> FFF Enterprises liked the structured process that we took them through. By soliciting input from each stakeholder group, everyone bought into the process and recommendations.</p>
				<p><span class="emphasis">Decision Framework:</span> There are a number of decisions coming out of this Roadmap engagement. The process provides a more objective framework to make better business decisions for the optimal path forward.</p>
				<p><span class="emphasis">Documentation:</span> FFF Enterprises now has a set of artifacts that can be referenced to understand their current eBusiness process, desired future state, and considerations to get there.</p>
				<p>As a result, FFF Enterprises has a roadmap to achieve their business goals:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Increase revenue in their largest channel while decreasing cost of selling.</li>
						<li>Increase company revenue by capitalizing on new B2C revenue opportunities.</li> 
						<li>Reduce cost by rationalizing three separate eCommerce sites and technologies to minimize on-going development and support costs.</li> 
					</ul>
